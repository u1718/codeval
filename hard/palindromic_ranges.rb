# A positive integer is a palindrome if its decimal representation (without
# leading zeros) is a palindromic string (a string that reads the same forwards
# and backwards). For example, the numbers 5, 77, 363, 4884, 11111, 12121 and
# 349943 are palindromes.
#
# A range of integers is interesting if it contains an even number of
# palindromes. The range [L, R], with L <= R, is defined as the sequence of
# integers from L to R (inclusive): (L, L+1, L+2, ..., R-1, R). L and R are the
# range's first and last numbers.
#
# The range [L1,R1] is a subrange of [L,R] if L <= L1 <= R1 <= R. Your job is to
# determine how many interesting subranges of [L,R] there are.
# Input sample:
#
# Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Each
# line in this file is one test case. Each test case will contain two positive
# integers, L and R (in that order), separated by a space. e.g.
#
# 1 2
# 1 7
# 87 88
#
# Output sample:
#
# For each line of input, print out the number of interesting subranges of [L,R]
# e.g.
#
# 1
# 12
# 1
#
# For the curious: In the third example, the subranges are: [87](0 palindromes),
# [87,88](1 palindrome),[88](1 palindrome). Hence the number of interesting
# palindromic ranges is 1
